We chart the explicit and implicit utopian visions of the politics of the period that, at once, criticized established black religious institutions and articulated alternative ways of imagining salvation.  We also explore the attempt by black theologians to translate the prophetic black church tradition into the idiom of black power.  Our aim is to keep in view the significance of the Black Power era for understanding the changing role and place of black religion in black public life.

This goal of this course is to familiarize students with the psychological research relevant to these questions. We will review theoretical perspectives on prejudice to develop an understanding of its cognitive, affective, and motivational underpinnings. We will also discuss how these psychological biases relate to evaluations of, and behavior toward, members of targeted groups.

Emphasis is on the legal regimes created by the Wagner Act of 1935 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The categories of rights that were created in these eras are constantly being re-designed and understood. We will look at how the law has interpreted these rights, and how far the expansion of workplace rights extends. Is the workplace best seen as a site for individual opportunity and personal growth, a furthering of American democracy, or an avenue to making money?

First come the chief art forms of ancient China: bronze ritual vessels, jade, lacquer, and silk. A turning point in their slow eclipse by representational art is the famous Qin terracotta army (210 BC). A little later a foreign religion, Indian Buddhism, came to China, bringing new forms of devotional art; we look at sculpture and cave temples from the 6th to the 9th century. The rest of the semester will be devoted mainly to painting and calligraphy, but porcelain, architecture, and gardens will also be mentioned.

Today we take the association of rhyme with poetry to be self-evident. But in the classical world, rhyme was known above all as an ornament of prose, and it was the troubadours who first made of rhyme a fundamental poetic device. This seminar will seek to understand the implications of this fact through close study of Arnaut Daniel, the troubadour whom Dante's Guinizelli called the "better craftsman of the mother tongue." Topics to be discussed include rhythm, meter, and consonance, ancient precedents to medieval rhyme, rhyme & prose, the linguistics analysis of rhyme, and rhyme across languages.

The city was the place where one most fully encountered an ordered society that one had to learn to read-perhaps to enter, or to "crash." Yet at the same time it was the place of maximal class stratification, class-conflict, and incipient anarchy.

We will explore radical shifts in the country's demographics and in story-telling modes, with an eye to how autobiographers have exploited their interactions.  At stake will be not only varying conceptions of identity, but also the stability of many terms on which autobiography might be thought to rely, including: self, memory, coherence, and history.

Our reading (and occasional listening) will be weighted toward contemporary English-language poetry but may well include some examples of British romantic poetry, 19th C.

The central premise is that the subject is not the persistence of an identity, nor the unfolding of an essence, nor even the recognition of the traumatic impossibility of any such identity. Instead, the construction of a political subject involves the laborious articulation of the consequences of an event such as the Haitian declaration of universal emancipation from slavery in 1804.

The focus is on methodology: on how to locate cases, statutes, treatises, trial records, and legal lives in their historical contexts, and on the differing ways historians have used legal texts as historical artifacts.  In the course of this course, students will be exposed to a number of differing and contending perspectives on American legal history.  It should offer students an opportunity to think broadly about the role of law in the wider culture and to try their hand at doing legal history.

As this maxim suggests, Egypt has long been considered a Rosetta Stone of sorts, offering a cipher for understanding general trends and challenges in the Arab world and beyond. Yet Cairo's position as the once undisputed cultural, political, social, and religious capital of the Middle East has been threatened from various directions. What explains Egypt's regional importance and its partial decline?

Contemporary investigation distinguishes normative from descriptive questions about belief and decision.  The former concern how our cognition ought to function; the latter, how it actually functions.  Fundamental theories of belief and decision will be presented in the course, and discussed from both the normative and descriptive perspectives.  Utility, logic, probability, and abduction will all be examined, with additional topics drawn from computability theory and from collective choice.

Sample topics include how we form impressions of people, how we make judgments about the causes of people's actions, and how we use stereotypes in person perception.  Related processes in self-perception will also be examined.  A theme of this course is that our perceptions of others (and of ourselves) are sometimes inaccurate because the processes that underlie them are not perfect.  We will pay considerable attention to these inaccuracies, and to their implications for misunderstanding and conflict.

At the psychological level, we will concentrate on classical and instrumental conditioning. Computationally, we will view these as exemplars of prediction learning and action selection, the pillars of reinforcement learning. Neurally, we will focus on the roles of dopamine and the basal ganglia at the systems level.

Three assumptions about society will be examined: 1) Durkheimian notion of "society as a thing"; 2) society as a composite of variables; 3) society as a meaning-producing process.

Much of this premature death, and the low quality of life that goes with it, is avoidable with well conceived and executed pubic policy.  But there's the rub.  Setting priorities for what government (and well-meaning outsiders) should do with very limited means requires hard choices--matters of life and death. The choices are limited both by the severe resource constraints in poor countries and constraints of effective implementation of programs.
