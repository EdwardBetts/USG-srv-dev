Students will listen to the sounded legacies of conquest, slavery, colonialism, and U.S. intervention and occupation. The effects of transnational migration on music's performance and reception will also be one of the key themes in the course.  We will not only consider the creative traditions and receptive worlds embedded in musical recordings, but will also pay attention to music's traces in literature, film, and other ephemera.

We will examine the national and colonial origins of anthropology, considering how western encounters with non-western peoples in the 19th-20th centuries opened questions about human kinship, history, economy, religion, language, sexuality, and personhood that continue to shape the horizons of our thought today. We will study this inheritance critically, exploring the changing concepts, methods, and ethics of anthropological research and writing, and evaluate their bearing on questions of power, justice, and identity in the present.

Pynchon	 	 	 	Buckminster Fuller once noted that the problem of diminishing global resources & the energy crisis was not one of fundamental lack but one of ignorance, failure of imagination & inability to use resources intelligently. Architecture consumes resources, demands expenditure of vast sums of money, is undeniably involved in the global exchange of energy & capital & the global distribution of material. Inevitably architecture is implicated in the social & environmental effects produced by these systems of exchange. How do architects situate themselves within this ecological need?

By drawing on political and social theories regarding marginalization, state rationality, and the public construction of justice, we will consider how the historical development of local prosecutorial and penal cultures reflects the spread of rationalized state institutions and of political and civil rights, even as these are shaped by local political demands.

An examination of Developmental Systems Theory, a conceptual framework that seeks to replace dichotomous accounts (nature-nurture, genes-environment, biology-culture) of organismal development. Major ideas for study include: 1) every trait is produced by the interaction of many developmental resources; 2) the significance of any one developmental resource is contingent upon the rest of the developing system; 3) an organism inherits a wide range of resources that interact to construct that organism's life cycle; and 4) evolution is not a matter of organisms being molded by environment, but of organism-environment systems changing over time.

What kinds of slavery existed in the 17th- and 18th-century American colonies? How did race affect the creation of slavery?

But, from the 1870s onwards, while its empire's boundaries continued to expand, its unchallenged global position was increasingly eroded.  In the aftermath of two world wars, the empire dissolved in only fifty years, and Britain itself was exposed to successive "invasions."  After 1945, the empire came home, in that onetime colonial peoples settled in Britain in unprecedented numbers; the country reluctantly joined the EU, and it accepted both US bases and increasingly Washington's lead in foreign policy.

Increasingly, journalists blog, record videos, create slideshows, and "tweet", all in addition to writing articles. They are expected to sift through and highlight the writings of others, yet journalism ultimately depends on original ideas and reporting. We will examine that evolving balance, reporting skills, journalistic ethics, the elements of blogging, crowdsourcing, and experiments with short-message formats, such as Twitter and live-blogging of news events.

Different intonation contours signal different sentence types--questions, for example, have systematically different 'tunes' from declarative statements, as do rebuttals, heges, and other speech-act types.  In addition, the placement of the intonation nucleus signals what is new and what is old information, as in the difference between "JOHN died" and "John DIED".

In keeping with this assessment, its advances into southeastern Europe from the mid-14th century onward are usually portrayed as stemming from a desire to expand the frontiers of the Islamic East at the expense of the Christian West.  This course will present an alternative explanation, one focusing on the extent to which the early Ottomans absorbed the peoples, practices, and nobilities of the pre-existing Christian peoples of the Balkans.

However, entrusting men and women with such discretionary power is problematic because they might abuse it. We will study how prominent theorists of executive power, including Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke and Publius have attempted to solve this conundrum.

This course introduces students to the political history that surrounded European scholars--Marx, Weber, and Durkheim--and their American "descendants"--WEB DuBois, the "Chicago School" scholars of urbanism, and the symbolic interactionists.  We ask what it was about urban life that convinced them society was in danger of complete fragmentation, and how these challenges informed their key ideas about the nature of the social order itself.  In precepts, students will learn about how the classical theorists influenced social theory in our own time.

We'll then explore some of the infinite possibilities of creating masked comic characters, based on variations from neutrality.

Art made collaboratively has had a dynamic effect on visual art, from questioning the myth of the solitary genius to expanding the forms art might take. Students will not be allowed to work alone; rather, collaborative effort will be the basis for all studio projects, presentations and discussions. The Guerilla Girls, Group Material, General Idea, Fischli and Weiss, Allora and Calzadilla, and Artur Zmijewski (among others) will serve as inspiration and points of departure.

It will explore the following questions: How should we organize ourselves as a political community? Why should we live under democratic institutions? What should the limits of the rule of the majority be? What is the relationship between political liberties and economic development? The course will examine these questions both from a normative and an empirical point of view.

Much of this premature death, and the low quality of life that goes with it, is avoidable with well conceived and executed pubic policy.  But there's the rub.  Setting priorities for what government (and well-meaning outsiders) should do with very limited means requires hard choices--matters of life and death. The choices are limited both by the severe resource constraints in poor countries and constraints of effective implementation of programs.
