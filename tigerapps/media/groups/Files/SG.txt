IE bugs:
   - Forms have borders
   - gap between nav and account bars
   - side menu headers too fat
   - borders on list title items, headers inconsistent
   - container pushed to far left
   - browse jump list goes down, not across
   - width is small (65%)
   - forms below sidebars
   - paginate buttons (and inline lists generally) fucked up

BUGS
   - image upload form out of wack
   - Message email is same as post email?
   - Can enter weird values for year, etc.
   - italicized menu?
   - FF doesn't space form rows (search forms), Chrome does
   - FF checkboxes always in the center
   - "Newer" and "First" terminology mismatch

IDEAS:
   - email: cal components
   - info on importing rss to fbook, twitter, whatever

TODO
   - file uploads (limit uploads to, say, 5; enforce in save)
   - div for group display in search/browse mode
      - image thumb
      - First part of description, categories
      - icon for group status (subscriber, member, officer, unaffiliated)
      - button for quickly subscribing
   - Promote/link form: aesthetics, error messages, required *
   - Feeds linked to PCal directly (import event model, include in entry)
      - needs to post event w/ group netid, or officer netid
      - ajax posts data to secret groups url; groups creates Entry object
   - email templates
   - dev facebook: autosuggest, pre-populate fields
   - Leadership section
      - link to (and from) ODUS
   - Banner

   - onclick tr for message board table
   - Display options global as well
   - Unread messages, member requests notices on index/account pages
   - message table: make rows clickable, change color on hover
   
   - Upon removal of member, demote to subscriber?
   - "warning" box for actions that have no effect (eg. demoting members)
   - url = group name

LATER
   - Registering a group emails usg@ (or someone)
   - Widget for group feeds
   - move to prod
      - check for any hard-coded urls or email addresses
